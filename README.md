# Things to Install
- Styled components: `npm i styled-components@5`
- React Router: `npm i react-router-dom`
- React Icons: `npm i react-icons`

# Styling
- Each component is styled by styling each component seperately. We can style each tag directly while also importing global styles such as containers and buttons and tweak it per component.
